## Description

This project is the back end for an e-commerce site which uses an Express.js API that has been configured to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

The user is able to view the inventory as formatted JSON lists of products, categories, and tags. They are then able to add, update, or delete any of the products, categories, or tags as needed.
